# Game Rules

### Philosophy

SFP rules are explicitly oriented towards promoting a philosophy around recreational swordfighting based around safety, fun, equity, and overall coolness. We want everyone to be able to participate in the event and have fun regardless of ability or prior experience in saber-related activities. In addition, we hope to increase fun through enhancing the showmanship aspects of swordfighting: fencing-style play is discouraged while visual flair reminiscient of historical, fantasy, or sci-fi influences is heavily encouraged.

### During the Round

#### Overview

* Rounds last until one person is eliminated in some way
* Points are binary (1, 0) based on who wins a round, with the exception of style tiebreakers (to be elaborated on later)

#### Hit Rules

  * First hit - round forfeit
  * Second hit - match forfeit
* **Body**
  * Round win
* **Arms / Legs**
  * Removes specific utility from opponent

#### Style Points

* Matches are given style ratings ranked 1-10. The "default" is a 3, representing no particular effort to style swordplay. Lower represents fencing meta-play and/or tryhardisms, while higher represents various aspects, including but not limited to:
  * Cool dialogue lines
  * Visual flair in body movement
  * Themed apparel
  * Unorthodox saber moves

### Don't forget to have fun!
